# NextJS + Electron + Web3


## High level specs

Uses NextJS to export a static build that is wrapped by Electron (windows, ubuntu and mac apps) and also can be deployed / accessed as a webapp.

## Using the frontend

You have 3 options to utilize this frontend: you can download one of the [app releases](https://github.com/rafinskipg/NextJS-Web3-Electron/releases), run the project locally or host a web version.
To build your own downlodoable application, please refer to [Building the application](#building)

### Downloading the frontend app:

Releases are bundled with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

The list of releases can be found [here](https://github.com/rafinskipg/NextJS-Web3-Electron/releases).

### Running the project locally:

> In order to perform other structural changes you will need to edit the codebase. Please refer to the section [Code Structure](#code-structure).

To run the project locally:

1. Install Node in your computer
2. Clone or download this repositoty
3. Install dependencies

- `yarn` or `npm install` to install the dependencies

4. Fill in the environment variables

- NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_PROVIDER_ARBITRUM
- NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_PROVIDER_MAINNET
- NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_PROVIDER_OPTIMISM

5. Execute `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the project.
6. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

To see more information about other available commands, check [Development Commands](#development-commands)

#### Development commands

This project is built on top of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/).

- `yarn dev` starts the development server locally.
- `yarn build` builds a static distribution of the project that can be hosted on IPFS.
- `yarn prettier` cleans the formatting of the code files.
- `yarn ipfs` deploys the portal to IPFS. Depends on setting correctly the environment variables for IPFS. See `scripts/ipfs` implementation if you want to change the IPFS pinner.
- `yarn electron:package` builds and bundles a downlodable/executable version of the app.
- `yarn electron:app` launches the application in the electron wrapper.
- `yarn eth-sdk -p renderer/eth-sdk` fetches the latest ABIs from the contracts defined at `renderer/eth-sdk/config.ts`
- `yarn testnet:mainnet --address 0x0000` launches a hardhat fork of mainnet on the block specified under `hardhat/mainnet.config.js`. It also seeds the addresses passed as parameter with test MKR, ETH and stETH. 

### Deploying the application on a server

There are different ways to deploy the frontend. It can be deployed on decentralized file systems like IPFS or Arweave, or using traditional infrastructure.

If you want to deploy the frontend easily, we recommend using services like [Fleek](https://fleek.co/)(Decentralized), [4Everland](https://www.4everland.org/)(Decentralized) or [Vercel](https://vercel.org)(Centralized).

If you want to upload manually this application to IPFS, you can do it by running `yarn ipfs` - This requires setting the IPFS pinner sdk correctly (see the file `scripts/ipfs` for more information) - or alternatively running `yarn build` and then uploading the dist folder to IPFS.
Once you optain the ipfs hash, you can introduce that in a decentralized name server like ENS.

#### Deploying on Vercel

1. Visit https://vercel.com/ and create an account
2. Import the project from Github.
3. Configure the list of environment variables, see [running the project locally](#running-the-project-locally) for a list of environment variables.
4. Configure the custom commands to use the `renderer` subfolder.

- Build: `next build renderer`
- Output directory: `renderer/.next`
- Development command : `next dev renderer --port $PORT`

#### Deploying on Fleek

1. Visit https://app.fleek.co/#/
2. Import the project from Github.
3. Choose a file hosting (IPFS or ICP)
4. Configure the output directory: `renderer/out`

You can now configure an ENS, HNS or custom domain through the Fleek interface, under the settings tab.

#### Configuring a decentralized DNS.

If you hosted your website on IPFS you can point your decentralized domain name to it. Follow the next links for more information:

- [ENS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/link-a-domain/) (.eth domains)
- [Unstoppabble domains](https://docs.unstoppabledomains.com/d-websites/connect-ipfs/)
- [Handshake](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/websites-on-ipfs/link-a-domain/#handshake)
- ## or alternatively [Ethstorage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRI-3RV_JHw)

### Building the downlodable application

The frontend uses [electronJS builder](https://www.electron.build/) to create a downlodable/installable application for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

To build the application yourself, run the command: `yarn electron:package`. You might need to update the file `package.json` with the new configuration. For more information about the configuration options, check out [Electron builder documentation](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration)

Do not expect building the application for all platforms from one platform. To build on Mac you need to be on a MacOS (for example). In order to build automatically for all platforms you can use tooling and automation like Github Actions or Travis. [See more info](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build.html).

This project is also configured with a Github Action that will build automatically the images for Windows, Mac and Linux when doing a new commit on the repo. For more information, check `.github/workflows/build.yml`, more information on how it works can be found [on this post](https://samuelmeuli.com/blog/2019-11-17-automating-the-release-of-electron-apps/).

#### Auto updating releases

The electron script located at `electron-app/main.js` includes the package electron-updater, that automatically checks for new versions of the application and notifies the user.

For auto-updating to work on macOS, your code needs to be signed. For more information check [this post](https://samuelmeuli.com/blog/2019-04-07-packaging-and-publishing-an-electron-app/).

## Running on test mode.

The application can be run locally on test mode. This is done by forking mainnet using Hardhat and Alchemy. 
To configure the Alchemy environment variable, add `TESTNET_ALCHEMY_KEY` to your `.env` file. 

The command to run the test network is : `yarn testnet:mainnet --address ADDRESS`. Is it needed to introduce an address that will receive the test tokens.

After that you will be able to connect localhost:8545 in your wallet (for example MetaMask) and see your additional balances.
